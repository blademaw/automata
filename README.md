# Automata
Current WIP about generating accepted strings for (currently) deterministic finite automata (DFA)  with finite alphabets.

### Future functionality
I'd like to someday implement the DFA to Regular Expression algorithm, though this is quite ambitious.

I also hope to implement nondeterministic automata (NDFA) support sometime in the future, though this may be computationally unrealistic.

Most of the work I hope to implement will be based on Sipser's Introduction to the Theory of Computation (3 ed., 2013)

### Built with
 * `itertools` for enumeration of possible strings
 * `math` for `inf` functionality
